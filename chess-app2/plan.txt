- make user sign so that loading chess.com games works with any user (TODO: give feedback)
- give analysis feedback while analyzing (hard)
- be able to load world chess championship pgns (hide spoilers)
- fix up home page (describe website + help section)
- make website save current game (when switching tabs, reloading page, etc..)

ALWAYS:
- performance
- fix bugs
- look nice

NEXT: fix glitchy piece bug (occurs after game is 50+ long)
